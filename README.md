📊 Built using: Microsoft Excel | Power BI | Tableau | SQL |
🧠 Project Overview

The HighCloud Airlines Analysis project provides a comprehensive view of airline performance metrics using real-world operational data.
This project was developed across three business intelligence tools — Excel, Power BI, and Tableau — to compare how each platform handles data visualization, KPI reporting, and interactivity.

The dashboards help airline stakeholders analyze load factors, passenger preferences, route performance, and carrier efficiency to make data-driven operational decisions.

# 🎯 Objective

To perform a multi-tool analysis of airline data and highlight:

Yearly, quarterly, and monthly load factor trends

Top-performing routes and carriers

Passenger preferences by airline

Flight distance distribution and operational patterns

Comparison of weekend vs. weekday utilization
